💥 Excited to share this with you. My friends and I presented our project presentation on Tuesday, February 12, under the supervision of Dr. Abeer, Misr International Technological University.

• The project : Autonomous Wheel chair

❑ The idea :

Our autonomous wheelchair is designed to address common challenges faced by patients in hospitals, offering a user-centric and technologically advanced solution. It aims to enhance independence
and improve mobility for patients in hospital environments.The autonomous wheelchair effortlessly identifies its destination, whether it's the radiology room, a patient's room, or any specific location within the hospital.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

❑ Project characteristics : 

1- The wheelchair moves efficiently navigating through hospital spaces and reaching designated destinations without outer guidance.

2- Capable of recognizing specific locations such as radiology rooms or patient areas, ensuring precise transportation within the hospital.

3- Offers a unique feature allowing the chair to seamlessly transform into a bed, providing patients with an additional level of comfort.

4- Flexibility to choose between self-driving mode for hands-free navigation or manual control using a joystick.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

❑ Mechanism of Action :

1- The user chooses the chair number and destination through the system interface.

2- Collect the necessary calculations using the ultrasonic sensor and the IR sensor to guide the chair.

3- The system extracts information about the desired destination, signaling the engines to start moving.

4- The chair moves at a predetermined speed. If an obstacle is detected at a distance of one meter, the ultrasonic sensor sends a signal to stop the engines and sounds an alarm until the path is clear.

5- When you reach the desired room, the IR sensor installed on the wall sends a signal to the motherboard, to ensure that the chair is connected to the intended location.
